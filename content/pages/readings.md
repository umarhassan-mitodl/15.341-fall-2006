4.  Does 'affect' have a role in the process of learning from experience?
5.  Are all these processes relevant to tacit as well as to explicit knowledge?

Networks (and power?)
{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}


As a single class, there are strong constraints on what I can expect to accomplish in our time together. I start with an assumption that everyone has at least heard of social networks-I know many of you have seen treatments of this topic in Ezra Zuckerman's class. For the assignment (see below), I am asking you to identify some research in an area in which you are interested in which network concepts have been used. The assignment will serve as useful background for our time together.

I have three goals for this class:

**Goal 1**: Orient students to an array of network concepts, with the aim of enlightening students' choices with respect to their own research agendas.  
**Goal 2**: Give students a tangible sense of how research progress is made in this area.  
**Goal 3**: Introduce some of my own work in this area.

Toward these ends, I see the class as proceeding as follows:

### Part I: (60 minutes)

1.  General introduction to the topic of social networks
    1.  Historical development of the field--Key branch points
    2.  Overview of how network applications have been used to address the "micro-macro" gap
    3.  Where organizations fit into the picture

(10 minutes break)

### Part II: (45 minutes)

2.  Illustrate how the network concepts and tools have co-evolved within one important domain
    1.  Labor markets and inequality

(10 minutes break)

### Part III: (45 minutes)

3.  Networks and ascriptive inequality in the labor market
    1.  Gender (and race)

I think of each of these parts as a kind of double-click on each preceding step. (As guidance for the required reading, I plan to wave at my own research in Part I--the Fernandez and McAdam paper. In Part II, the discussion will culminate with the Fernandez, Castilla and Moore paper. Part III will focus in on my most current research--Fernandez and Sosa and Rubineau and Fernandez papers).

### Assignment

In preparation for the class, choose an area of research that you have been thinking about. How have network concepts and ideas been used in this area?

Imagine you are committed to doing research in this area. Which network approaches do you think will be fruitful in your view? Less than fruitful? Why?

### Study questions

1.  Which theories that apply to small groups also translate into larger groups (20, 50, 100 people)? Why or why not?
2.  What are the similarities and differences in the approaches to studying groups seen in the Hinds & Mortensen and Phillips & Loyd papers? What do you think are the benefits and limitations in these different approaches?
3.  Which three theories or topics relating to small groups do you feel are most in need of further research and why?
4.  How applicable are theories of teams in organizations to small groups in other contexts, and vice versa? What are the key differences, and are they important?

### Study questions

1.  How do our core assumptions about team building, team composition, and team performance need to change when we take more of an "external perspective" on teams?
2.  What role do temporal dynamics have in our understanding of team tasks and team processes?
3.  What new research would shed more light on this "external perspective" of teams?

### Study questions

For this session, you may choose to answer one (or both) of the following questions. Your total text for the two questions should be about 2 pages.

1.  What directions or topics for future research on organization design seem most promising to you? Why?
2.  Please pick one or more topics that you think should be included in the Handbook for Collective Intelligence and write sections of the handbook on these topics. For example, you might pick a topic already listed but not fleshed out (such as "collective mind", "transactive memory", or "communities of practice") and then find and summarize literature relevant to that topic. Or you might pick a topic that is not yet listed, but which you think should be, and summarize literature about that topic. It is preferable to write your text as complete sentences with references (and web links, if available). However, you are also welcome to include some partial outlines or lists, if you'd like. To get credit for this assignment, you need to hand in your contributions as a separate document, but you are also encouraged to actually make the contributions on-line, too.

4.  Beer proposes alternative approaches to change. What characteristics of these approaches are illustrated in the Japanese auto industry?
